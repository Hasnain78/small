--Payroll System Development--

ABC Finance company hired you as a software developer. Your first assignment is to create a simple Payroll System for the company to perform payroll calculations based on an employee inheritance hierarchy that meets the following requirements:

The company has Salaried employees and they are paid a fixed salary regardless of the number of hours they work. Their salary is calculated by adding the basic salary, TA (Travelling allowance), DA (Dearness allowance) and HRA (House rent allowance).

To make the system reusable and extensible, the system must be constructed using object-oriented methodology.
